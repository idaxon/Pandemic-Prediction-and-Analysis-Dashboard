# Pandemic Prediction and Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project is designed to analyze and predict **COVID-19 pandemic trends** using machine learning models. The dashboard provides an interactive way to visualize confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and predictions for various countries, making it an essential tool for COVID-19 analysis.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Visualize time-series data for confirmed, deaths, recovered, and active cases.
  - View global spread of COVID-19 on an interactive map.
- **Prediction Model**:
  - Forecast future confirmed cases and deaths for the selected number of days.
  - Get insights into peak case load estimates.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Dropdowns, tables, and graphs for easy navigation.
  - Real-time updates based on user input.
- **Focus on COVID-19**:
  - Designed specifically for COVID-19 pandemic analysis and forecasting.

## Dataset
The project uses the **COVID-19 Clean Complete Dataset** from Kaggle. This dataset contains detailed records of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-name.git

## Libraries Used
The following libraries were used to build this project:

- **Dash**: For creating the interactive web application.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations like time-series plots and global maps.
- **Pandas**: For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models to predict future trends.
- **Python**: The core language used for development.

## Project Highlights

### Special Focus on COVID-19:
- This project is specifically tailored for **COVID-19 analysis and forecasting**.
- Provides detailed trends and future predictions for pandemic preparedness.

### Advanced Predictions:
- Predict confirmed cases, deaths, and estimate the **peak case load** for any selected country.
- **Polynomial Regression model** ensures better accuracy for time-series predictions.

### Global Perspective:
- Visualize the **global spread** of COVID-19 on an interactive map.
- Compare different countries' pandemic progression.

### Customizable:
- Select the **country** and prediction period (**days**) based on your preferences.
- Supports **flexible input** for better decision-making.

## How It Works

### Input Selection:
1. Choose a **country** from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter the **number of days** for prediction.

### Visualize Data:
- View real-time trends in **confirmed**, **deaths**, **recovered**, and **active cases**.

### Analyze Predictions:
- Get future predictions for **confirmed cases**, **deaths**, and **peak case load estimates**.

### Global Insights:
- Explore the global spread of the pandemic using the **interactive map**.
